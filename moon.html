               The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite and the fifth largest natural satellite in the Solar System. The average center-to-center distance between the Earth and the Moon is 384,403 km, or about thirty times the diameter of the Earth. The Moon's diameter is 3,474 km,[14] which is slightly more than a quarter of the Earth's diameter. Therefore, the volume of the Moon is 2% of the volume of the Earth. Its mass is 81.3 times less than the mass of the Earth. The gravitational effect on its surface is approximately 17% of gravity. The Moon completes one orbit around the Earth in 27 days and 7 hours. As a result of periodic changes in the geometry of the Earth, Moon and Sun, phases of the Moon occur every 29.5 days.

The Moon is the celestial body on which people land and walk. The first artificial object to escape gravity and go into space and pass near the Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 1 satellite. The first human-made object to hit the lunar surface was the moon Luna 2. The first photographs of the normally invisible other side of the Moon were taken by the Luna 3 satellite. All three satellites were launched into space in 1959. Luna 9 is the first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the lunar surface, and Luna 10 is the first unmanned spacecraft to enter lunar orbit. These two satellites were launched into space in 1966.[14] The US's Apollo program is the only space program to have accomplished manned missions to date, with six successful landings between 1969 and 1972. Direct human exploration of the Moon ended with the end of the Apollo program.

The most widely accepted origin explanation suggests that the Moon formed 4.51 billion years ago, from the debris of a giant collision between Earth (shortly after Earth) and a hypothetical Mars-sized object called Theia. It was subsequently pulled into a more distant orbit due to tidal interaction with the Earth. The near side of the Moon is notable for its bright, ancient crustal highlands, with dark volcanic maria ("dark seas") filling the gaps between prominent impact craters. The major impact basins and most of their dark surfaces (mare) were in place by the end of the Imbrian period, about three billion years ago. The lunar surface is relatively non-reflective, with a degree of reflection slightly brighter than worn asphalt. However, since its angular diameter is large, it becomes the brightest celestial object in the night sky during the full moon. The apparent size of the Moon is almost the same as that of the Sun, causing it to almost completely cover the Sun during a total solar eclipse.
